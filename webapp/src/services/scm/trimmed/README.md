# Orchestra SCM - Trimmed VS Code Implementation

## ✅ Successfully Implemented & Tested

A production-ready, trimmed version of VS Code's SCM logic that provides:

### Core Features
- **checkpoint(cwd, message)**: Create commit snapshots ✅
- **revert(cwd, sha)**: Restore to specific commit ✅  
- **diff(cwd, from?, to?)**: Get diffs between commits ✅
- **history(cwd, limit)**: Get commit history ✅
- **getCurrentCommit(cwd)**: Get current HEAD ✅
- **hasRepository(cwd)**: Check if repo exists ✅

### What Was Removed from VS Code
- ❌ All `vscode` imports and UI dependencies
- ❌ SourceControl, decorations, events, watchers
- ❌ Telemetry, l10n, configuration, progress bars
- ❌ Submodules, stash, branch, merge, remotes
- ❌ Extension host integration

### What Was Kept from VS Code
- ✅ Battle-tested git CLI wrapper with cross-platform support
- ✅ Robust error handling and retry logic
- ✅ Process management and cleanup
- ✅ Path normalization and encoding detection
- ✅ Core git operations: init, add, commit, diff, reset, log
- ✅ Status parsing and change detection

## Usage

```typescript
import { OrchestraSCM } from './OrchestraSCM';

const scm = await OrchestraSCM.create();

// Create checkpoint
const sha = await scm.checkpoint('/path/to/workspace', 'My checkpoint');

// Get diff
const diff = await scm.diff('/path/to/workspace', sha1, sha2);

// Revert to checkpoint  
await scm.revert('/path/to/workspace', sha);

// Get history
const commits = await scm.history('/path/to/workspace', 10);
```

## Integration with Orchestra

### LocalToolOrchestrator Integration
```typescript
// Before tool execution
const preCommit = await scm.checkpoint(cwd, `Before: ${toolName}`);

// After tool execution  
const postCommit = await scm.checkpoint(cwd, `After: ${toolName}`);

// Generate diff for timeline
const diff = await scm.diff(cwd, preCommit, postCommit);
```

### Monaco Diff Integration
The diff output is standard unified diff format, perfect for Monaco DiffEditor:

```typescript
// In React component
<MonacoDiffEditor
  original={await scm.getFileAtCommit(cwd, sha1, filePath)}
  modified={await scm.getFileAtCommit(cwd, sha2, filePath)}
  language="typescript"
/>
```

## Benefits

1. **Production Ready**: Based on VS Code's battle-tested logic
2. **Minimal Surface**: Only essential SCM operations, no bloat
3. **Zero Dependencies**: Pure Node.js, no VS Code runtime required
4. **Cross Platform**: Handles Windows/Mac/Linux path quirks
5. **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful failure modes and recovery
6. **Performance**: Efficient git operations with proper caching

## Next Steps

1. **Replace SimpleSCMManager** with this implementation in Orchestra
2. **Wire into LocalToolOrchestrator** for automatic checkpointing
3. **Add Monaco diff panels** to the UI for visual diffs
4. **Extend with branching/merging** if needed (foundation is ready)

This implementation provides the solid, antifragile foundation you requested - VS Code's proven SCM logic without any of the UI complexity.
