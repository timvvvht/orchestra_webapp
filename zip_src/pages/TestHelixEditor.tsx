The new default markdown theme for Orchestraâ€”where typography meets transcendence.

## What's Changed

We've replaced the colorful Tokyo Night theme with something more refined:

### Before (Tokyo Night)
- ðŸ”´ Red H1 headers
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow H2 headers  
- ðŸŸ¢ Green H3 headers
- ðŸ”µ Cyan bold/italic text

### After (Helix)
- Monochromatic elegance with subtle accents
- Typography-driven hierarchy using size and weight
- Glassmorphic code blocks that float above the page
- Smooth micro-interactions on every element

## See It In Action

Notice how **bold text** and *italic text* no longer scream for attention. They simply guide your eye through the content with grace.

Links like [this one](https://example.com) and [[wiki links]] have subtle hover effects that feel natural, not forced.

\`\`\`typescript
// Code blocks now have depth and dimension
interface HelixTheme {
  philosophy: "Less is exponentially more";
  approach: "Typography as interface";
  result: "Invisible design that elevates content";
}
\`\`\`

## The Reading Experience

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."  
> â€” Leonardo da Vinci

Every element has been carefully considered to create a reading experience that feels effortless. The spacing breathes. The typography guides. The interactions delight without distraction.

### Try These Interactions

- [ ] Hover over headers to see the accent line
- [ ] Click on links to see the underline animation
- [ ] Notice how code blocks lift on hover
- [ ] Watch the cursor breathe as you type
